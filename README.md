Scene 1:
Mama Wale hums as she scoops chai masala into a pot, her worn hands moving with practiced ease. Idowu watches, wide-eyed, trying to imitate her every stir.

Idowu: Mama, how come your tea always tastes better than mine? Is it a secret spice?

Mama Wale: (Winks) A secret ingredient, maybe. A dash of sass, a sprinkle of laughter, and a whole lot of love. You can't fake that, boy.

Suddenly, Chief Balogun struts in, his entourage trailing behind him like overbrewed tea leaves.

Chief Balogun: Make way for the chief! And prepare the finest brew, woman. My important negotiations require the sharpest of minds, fueled by the strongest of teas.

Mama Wale: (Raises an eyebrow) Strongest, eh? My "Chief's Special" might surprise you. It's got a kick like a donkey on a sugar high.

Chief Balogun scoffs, but secretly gulps when he sees the fiery red chili flakes Mama Wale adds with a mischievous grin
